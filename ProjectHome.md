imagine walking into the restaurant. As you enter you are issued with a token/key. At the table you connect to the local WiFi?  hotspot. You enter your token on the android smartphone and get presented with a nice menu including pictures of all the dishes. You then place your order with the android Touchscreen. As you enjoy your meal you can place more orders for drinks etc and communicate with your waiter via your android phone application.
